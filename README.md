This is a rewrite of my prototype Kassandra, which was written in Python.  This is in Go.   Why the change?   Why not.  

When I wrote the Kassandra it helpped me get some of my ideas down.   I need to restructure some of it, which can either be done by cleaning up the exisiting code or rewrite. 

MarkLlama, made some good arguments for using Go instead.  I've got Kassandra checked in, I'm working on it a little, but now I have a new Shiny.
